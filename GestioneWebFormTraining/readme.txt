Thank you for installing the IoC framework - a simple yet powerful Inversion of Control framework.

There's a general introduction to Inversion of Control under http://maikheller.info/IoC/

A documentation of this framework and some quick start examples can be found under http://maikheller.info/IoC/DoxyDocu/

Feel free to send any positive or negative feedback to info@maikheller.info
